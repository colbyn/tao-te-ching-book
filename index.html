            <p>The tao that can be described <br>
                is not the eternal Tao. <br>
                The name that can be spoken <br>
                is not the eternal Name.</p>
            <p>The nameless is the boundary of Heaven and Earth. <br>
                The named is the mother of creation.</p>
            <p>Freed from desire, you can see the hidden mystery. <br>
                By having desire, you can only see what is visibly real.</p>
            <p>Yet mystery and reality <br>
                emerge from the same source. <br>
                This source is called darkness.</p>
            <p>Darkness born from darkness. <br>
                The beginning of all understanding.</p>

            <p>When people see things as beautiful, <br>
                ugliness is created. <br>
                When people see things as good, <br>
                evil is created.</p>
            <p>Being and non-being produce each other. <br>
                Difficult and easy complement each other. <br>
                Long and short define each other. <br>
                High and low oppose each other. <br>
                Fore and aft follow each other.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Master <br>
                can act without doing anything <br>
                and teach without saying a word. <br>
                Things come her way and she does not stop them; <br>
                things leave and she lets them go. <br>
                She has without possessing, <br>
                and acts without any expectations. <br>
                When her work is done, she takes no credit. <br>
                That is why it will last forever. </p>

            <p>Do not display your treasures <br>
                or people will become envious.</p>
            <p>The Master leads by <br>

                filling their bellies, <br>

            <p>The Tao is like an empty container: <br>
                it can never be emptied and can never be filled. <br>
                Infinitely deep, it is the source of all things. <br>
                It dulls the sharp, unties the knotted, <br>
                shades the lighted, and unites all of creation with dust.</p>
            <p>It is hidden but always present. <br>
                I don't know who gave birth to it. <br>
                It is older than the concept of God. </p>

                she treats everyone like a straw dog.</p>
            <p>The space between Heaven and Earth is like a bellows; <br>

                The more it is used, the more it produces; <br>

            <p>The Tao of Heaven is eternal, <br>
                and the earth is long enduring. <br>
                Why are they long enduring? <br>
                They do not live for themselves; <br>
                thus they are present for all beings.</p>
            <p>The Master puts herself last; <br>
                And finds herself in the place of authority. <br>
                She detaches herself from all things; <br>
                Therefore she is united with all things. <br>
                She gives no thought to self. <br>

                It gathers in unpopular places. <br>
                Thus it is like the Tao.</p>
            <p>The location makes the dwelling good. <br>
                Depth of understanding makes the mind good. <br>
                A kind heart makes the giving good. <br>
                Integrity makes the government good. <br>

            <p>Success is as dangerous as failure, <br>
                and we are often our own worst enemy.</p>
            <p>What does it mean that success is as dangerous as failure? <br>
                He who is superior is also someone's subordinate. <br>
                Receiving favor and losing it both cause alarm. <br>
                That is what is meant by success is as dangerous as failure.
                <br>
                What does it mean that we are often our own worst enemy? <br>
                The reason I have an enemy is because I have "self". <br>
                If I no longer had a "self", I would no longer have an enemy.
            </p>
            <p>Love the whole world as if it were your self; <br>

            <p>Look for it, and it can't be seen. <br>
                Listen for it, and it can't be heard. <br>
                Grasp for it, and it can't be caught. <br>
                These three cannot be further described, <br>
                so we treat them as The One.</p>
            <p>Its highest is not bright. <br>
                Its depths are not dark. <br>
                Unending, unnamable, it returns to nothingness. <br>
                Formless forms, and imageless images, <br>

                Fluid as melting ice. <br>
                Whole as an uncarved block of wood. <br>

                Turbid as muddied water.</p>

                Can you remain tranquil until right action occurs by itself?</p>
            <p>The Master doesn't seek fulfillment. <br>
                For only those who are not full are able to be used <br>

            <p>The greatest virtue you can have <br>
                comes from following only the Tao; <br>

            <p>Even though the Tao is intangible and evasive, <br>
                we are able to know it exists. <br>
                Intangible and evasive, yet it has a manifestation. <br>

                Its vitality is very genuine. <br>
                Within it we can find order.</p>
            <p>Since the beginning of time, the Tao has always existed. <br>
                It is beyond existing and not existing. <br>

            <p>The great Tao flows unobstructed in every direction. <br>
                All things rely on it to conceive and be born, <br>
                and it does not deny even the smallest of creation. <br>
                When it has accomplished great wonders, <br>
                it does not claim them for itself. <br>
                It nourishes infinite worlds, <br>
                yet it doesn't seek to master the smallest creature. <br>
                Since it is without wants and desires, <br>
                it can be considered humble. <br>
                All of creation seeks it for refuge <br>
                yet it does not seek to master or control. <br>
                Because it does not seek greatness; <br>
                it is able to accomplish truly great things. </p>

            <p>The highest good is not to seek to do good, <br>
                but to allow yourself to become it. <br>
                The ordinary person seeks to do good things, <br>

            <p>The Master does not force virtue on others, <br>

            <p>The kind person acts from the heart, <br>

                The righteous person acts out of pity, <br>
                yet leaves many things undone. <br>
                The moral person will act out of duty, <br>
                and when no one will respond <br>
                will roll up his sleeves and uses force.</p>
            <p>When the Tao is forgotten, there is righteousness. <br>
                When righteousness is forgotten, there is morality. <br>
                When morality is forgotten, there is the law. <br>

                The infant is protected from <br>

                It seems too easy for anyone to use.</p>
            <p>There are three jewels that I cherish: <br>
                compassion, moderation, and humility. <br>
                With compassion, you will be able to be brave, <br>
                With moderation, you will be able to give to others, <br>
                With humility, you will be able to become a great leader. <br>
                To abandon compassion while seeking to be brave, <br>
                or abandoning moderation while being benevolent, <br>
                or abandoning humility while seeking to lead <br>
                will only lead to greater trouble. <br>
                The compassionate warrior will be the winner, <br>
                and if compassion is your defense you will be secure. <br>
                Compassion is the protector of Heavens salvation. </p>

            <p>There is an old saying: <br>
                "It is better to become the passive <br>
                in order to see what will happen. <br>
                It is better to retreat a foot <br>
                than to advance only an inch."</p>
            <p>This is called <br>
                being flexible while advancing, <br>
                pushing back without using force, <br>
                and destroying the enemy without engaging him.</p>
            <p>There is no greater disaster <br>

                Underestimating your enemy <br>
                means losing your greatest assets. <br>
